# BlackJack Project

# Description
- This project simulates a blackjack game.
- It is for 1 - 3 human players and a computer dealer
- each player plays against the dealer
- Aces are 11
- each play can hit or stand

# Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse IDE, git

# Lessons Learned
- be sure to cast or will be calling wrong method
- in an app loop, make sure everything is instantiated newly or (lists) are cleared
- keep printlns local (when they are spread out i get repeats and it's annoying and sloppy)
- Interface is a helpful way to check type of something. I made an IDealer interface that is implemented by the BJDealer and it's helpful to check
 for this implementation when checking the player list for behavior (computer or human). Also if I wanted more types of dealer I could use IDealer
